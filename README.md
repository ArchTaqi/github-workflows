## GitHub issues

- Free and unlimited, for both public and private
- It has fantastic inter-linking abilities. You can paste in URLs to other issues (in any other repository on GitHub), Your issue will pull in the title of the other issue, plus that other issue will get back a link to yours - taking issue visibility rules into account.
- It has excellent search, both within a repo, across all of your repos or even across the whole of GitHub if you've completely forgotten where you put something.
- It has a comprehensive API, both for exporting notes and creating and editing new ones. Add GitHub Actions, triggered by issue events, and you can automate it to do almost anything.
